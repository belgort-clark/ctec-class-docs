# Visual Studio Code: Staging Files and Performing a Commit in Visual Studio Code

## Staging Files

1. **Git** will keep track of files that get modified, added, or deleted to your **local repository** on your computer.
2. Before you can **commit** and **push** your work back to **GitHub** you will first need to **stage** the files that you want to become part of the **commit**.
3. Start by opening the Visual Studio Code **Source Control** pane in the sidebar. It's the icon that looks like a **tuning fork** or the **letter Y**.
4. You will see a **list of files** that **Git** has identified. Next to each file you will see either the letter **U** or **M**. **U** is for updated and **M** for modified.
5. You will now need to **stage** the files that you want to become part of your **commit**.
6. To stage a file hover your mouse over the file and then click the **+** sign.
7. The file will then move to the **Stage Changes** section within **Visual Studio Code**.
8. Once all of your files have been staged, you are now ready to **commit** them.
9. Above the **Stage Changes** section look for an input area that contains the text **Message**.

## Committing Your Changes 

1. In this box you will type what is called a **Commit Message**. You will see the commit message in GitHub when you look at your repository from the web.
2. Each assignment and lab will provide you with a specific commit message that you will need to enter.
3. After you enter the message click on the checkmark. This will perform the actual commit.
4. Next up is to push your changes back to GitHub.
5. To do this bring up the command palette in Visual Studio Code (Control+Shift+P on PC and Command+Shift+P on Mac).
6. Type in **git push** and then press enter.
7. Your files will then be pushed back to GitHub.
8. Login to GitHub and make sure you can see that changes that you committed.
